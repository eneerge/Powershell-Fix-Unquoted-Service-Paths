# Powershell-Fix-Unquoted-Service-Paths
This script can be setup to run in NAble Nsight RMM as an automated task to automatically fix all unquoted service path vulnerabilities.

This script is a modified version of the following script which is fantastic:

The only difference is that I've modified it to run automatically on the local machine that the script executes on. This can be set up as an automated script in N-Able Nsight RMM or any other RMM solution to automatically correct unquoted service path vulnerabilities.
